           In this game, the more times you are able to press the button, the more points you will earn.
            Your goal in this task is to earn as many points as possible. However, every time you press a button after the X comes on the screen you will
            lose a significant number of points, so be sure to stop pressing as quickly as possible.




            <br>

            There will be 40 short rounds of this game. The color targets may change position between the rounds.

            <br>
            <br>

            We would like you to remain focused during this task, but on some of the rounds we want you to try as hard as you are able.



            <br>
            <br>


            Be ready to put your fingers on the  "f" key and the "j" key.
